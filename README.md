# CPP_Project_BookStore

This project, developed in multiple learning stages, is an application for managing a bookstore. It provides functionalities for adding, deleting and updating books, as well as sorting and searching options based on various criteria. The application includes a book purchasing feature and implements a shopping cart. I used the Observer Pattern. The graphical interface is built with Qt.
